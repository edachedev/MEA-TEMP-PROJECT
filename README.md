## TEMPERATURE CONVERTER DOCUMENTATION

#### INTRODUCTION
The Temperature Converter is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application built using the Tkinter library in Python. It allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit units.

#### FEATURES
  ⦁	Convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.\
  ⦁	Input validation to ensure that the user enters a valid temperature.

#### REQUIREMENTS
⦁	Python 3.x installed on your system.\
⦁	Tkinter library (usually included with Python installations).
#### INSTALLATION
  There is no separate installation required for the Temperature Converter. Simply ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

#### USAGE
1.	Run the Python script temperature_converter.py.
2.	Enter the temperature value in the provided entry field.
3.	Select the unit of the entered temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit) using the radio buttons.
4.	Click the "Convert" button to perform the conversion.
5.	The converted temperature will be displayed below the button.

### CODE OVERVIEW
The Temperature Converter application consists of the following components:\
  ⦁	Main Window: The main window of the application where all the user interface elements are placed.\
  ⦁	Temperature Entry: An entry field where the user can input the temperature value.\
  ⦁	Unit Selection: Radio buttons allowing the user to select the unit of the entered temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit).\
  ⦁	Convert Button: Button to trigger the conversion process.\
  ⦁	Result Label: Label to display the converted temperature.

### CODE EXPLANATION
The code is structured into a single Python script, temperature_converter.py, which contains the following functions and components:\
  ⦁	convert_temperature(): This function retrieves the temperature value entered by the user, along with the selected unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit). It then performs the conversion calculation and updates the result label with the converted temperature.\
  ⦁	Main Window Setup: The main Tkinter window is created, along with the necessary user interface components such as labels, entry fields, radio buttons, buttons, and result labels.\
  ⦁	Event Loop: The application enters the Tkinter event loop (app.mainloop()), which waits for user interactions and handles GUI events. \

## CONCLUSION
The Temperature Converter application provides a simple yet effective way to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit units. It can be used for educational purposes or as a standalone utility for temperature conversion tasks.
